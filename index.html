      France had lost 1.3 million soldiers, including 25% of French men aged 18â€“30, as well as 400,000 civilians. 
      France had also been more physically damaged than any other nation; the so-called zone rouge (Red Zone), the most industrialized 
      region and the source of most coal and iron ore in the north-east, had been devastated, and in the final days of the war mines had 
      been flooded and railways, bridges and factories destroyed.[39] Clemenceau intended to ensure the security of France, by weakening 
      Germany economically, militarily, territorially and by supplanting Germany as the leading producer of steel in Europe.
